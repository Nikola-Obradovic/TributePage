<div class="childhood and inspiration" >

<p class="paragraph">Eiichiro Oda was born in Kumamoto, Japan on the 1st of January 1975. He was greatly influenced by anime and manga, especially by another popular anime series called Dragon Ball by Akira Toriyama. Thus Monkey D. Luffy, the main character in One Piece, was inspired by the main character from Dragon Ball, Goku, sharing many similarities in behavior with Goku. Oda also chose to write One Piece to be about pirates because he was inspired by a show called Vicky the Viking.</p>

<p class="paragraph">In 1996, Oda made two different versions of a manga called <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Romance_Dawn" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Romance Dawn</a>, which is a story that served as a prototype for One Piece. Afterwards in 1997, Oda started making One Piece and the first chapter as Romance Dawn. The first version of Romance Dawn was made into an adaptation called "One Piece: Romance Dawn Story" and the second version was made into the 907th episode of One Piece, celebrating the 20th anniversary of the series.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Oda has a very unique art style with a variaty of characters in One Piece, many of which do not fit into the typical pirate setting. This variaty of characters, as well as the distinctive settings in which the characters of this manga find themselves in, adds a lot of charm to the franchise. These are some of the drawings from the manga One Piece which capture the unique art style of Oda.</p>

<p class="paragraph">The art style has changed over the years, with many new improvements implemented in the most recent chapters and episodes of One piece. To showcase this change, here is a video posted by Crunchyroll Collection which best displays the change in art style of the anime.</p>
